Phase 1 - Surface level scrape of GH forums
	Goal: Determine insights about which keycap sets make it from being an interest check to a group buy (including what profiles/manufacturers seem to be doing).

	Approach: Initial data gathering by scraping the "Group Buys and Preorders" and "Interest Checks" GeekHack forums for topics relating to keycap sets.


	P1 SCRAPING
	---
	Initial level is just to scrape from the forum titles, then maybe try to scrape into the posts in a future round.
	Will have to scrape from a search query -> so that I can get the date the post was created.
	This will also yield the post ids needed to access specific posts

	Scrapeable from search page:
		- board title (ex. "Group Buys and Preorders")
		- topic link
		- topic title
		- poster link
		- poster name
		- topic created timestamp 

	Scrapeable from forum list:
		- board title
		- topic link
		- topic title
		- poster link
		- poster name
		- topic views
		- topic replies
		- last reply timestamp
		- (last replier link)
		- (last replier name)

	The phase 1 scraping part of the project will grab this data and store in CSVs for later analysis

	
	P1 DATA PROCESSING
	---
	Desired derived data:
		- board title
		- topic UID (contained in topic link)
		- group buy or interest check (from title tag)
		- keyset type code(s) (from title prefix)
			- keyset material
			- keyset profile
			- keyset manufacturer (in some cases)
		- keyset name (after the type in the title)
		- round? (potentially from title)
		- date posted (from topic created timestamp)
		- creator UID (from poster link)
		- topic views
		- topic replies
		- date last active (from last reply timestamp)

	Keyset type will be a prefix for the name: and as there are only a fixed number of manufacturers/codes this is a pretty good way to find the title in the string as well.
		- I did notice that a few (comfy PBT) have the type code after the name
		- also some actually spell out the manufacturer (saw this with infinikey)
		- or have two type codes (infinikey PBT islander)
			- to deal with this just have a hierarchy with the more specific one getting the nod
			- manually set up a matrix for the profile, manufacturer etc. to fill this data based on the type code

	Known type codes:
		- GMK
		- PBT
		- ePBT
		- SA
		- HSA
		- KAT (Keyreative)
		- KAM (also Keyreative)
		- DSA
		- IFK (Infinikey)
		- JTK
		- CRP (Hammerworks?)
		- SP (Signature Plastics)
		- Cherry?
		- MDA?
		- XDA?
		- MG? (Melgeek?)

	How to identify the set title: First search for and identify "[GB]", "[IC]" and similar (needed due to legacy posts in GB forum) -> find any type codes -> try to find a non-whitespace separator after the first type code -> if exists grab max two words up to that non-whitespace, otherwise just one after the type code (ignoring other type codes) -> or if there's nothing left grab any word before the type code

    More advanced parser based title analysis
        - split everything into tokens (might have to be more complicated than just off of whitespace)
        - detect [GB], [IC] thread type codes  and log
        - detect 'infocodes' (GMK, IFK, Infinikey) and log
        - detect 'separators' ('|', ' - ' or being in () or [])
            -include permutations where less whitespace is used such as '(emoticon)- '
                -this probably can work with whitespace on one side
        - detect 'non-title' words ('shipping', 'closed', 'live', keycap(s)/keyset(s))
            -consume these or treat as separator?
        - find section with the infocodes, delete everything outside (thread codes/separators as barriers)
        - what's left, excluding any infocodes should be the title
            -might also want to strip hanging basic words like "is, a, the" from the end of titles



	P1 DATA ANALYSIS
	---
	Basic insights:
		-Most popular profile/manufacturer
		-Attrition rate from ICs to GBs
			-Split per profile/manu/type code
		-Average time from initial IC to eventual GB (+ outliers)
		-Average # of GBs per user who made a GB
			-Attrition rate for first time ICers (are most GBs coming from popular accounts)
		-Any GBs posted from different accounts as matching ICs?
		-Correlation of IC views/posts to existance of corresponding GB
			-cutoff point?
		-GB/IC rate over time
